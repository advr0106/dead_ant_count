# Dead ant count algorithm

## Description
This project implement an algorithm to count dead ant in a given string.

## Installation

```
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the proyect directory.
```bash
cd /path/to/dead_ant_count
```
3. Run the 'main.py' to process the string and count dead ants.
```bash
py main.py
```
4. If u want to quit just press q.

## Testing
